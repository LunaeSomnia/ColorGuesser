# ColorGuesser

A small color-guessing game I created to teach friends how to code their first project.

---

## How to Play

1. A random color will be shown.
2. You must guess the hex code that matches it using the R, G & B sliders.
3. Once you submit, the game compares your guess and shows:
   - The original color
   - Your guessed color
   - The accuracy percentage
4. Press **Play Again** to try a new color.
